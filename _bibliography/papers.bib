	abstract = {Artificial intelligence has become an important tool in fight against COVID-19. Machine learning models for COVID-19 global pandemic predictions have shown a higher accuracy than the previously used statistical models used by epidemiologists. With the advent of quantum machine learning, we present a comparative analysis of continuous variable quantum neural networks (variational circuits) and quantum backpropagation multilayer perceptron (QBMLP). We analyze the convoluted and sporadic data of two affected countries, and hope that our study will help in effective modeling of outbreak while throwing a light on bright future of quantum machine learning.},

	abstract = {Games involving quantum strategies often yield higher payoff. Here, we study a practical realization of the three-player dilemma game using the superconductivity-based quantum processors provided by IBM Q Experience. We analyze the persistence of the quantum advantage under corruption of the input states and how this depends on parameters of the payoff table. Specifically, experimental fidelity and error are observed not to be properly anti-correlated; i.e., there are instances where a class of experiments with higher fidelity yields a greater error in the payoff. Further, we find that the classical strategy will always outperform the quantum strategy if corruption is higher than 50\%.},

	abstract = {Quantum coherence and entanglement originate from the superposition principle. We derive a rigorous relation between the \$\$\{l\_1\}\$\$-norm of coherence and concurrence, in that we show that the former is always greater than the latter. This result highlights the hierarchical relationship between coherence and concurrence, and proves coherence to be a fundamental and ubiquitous resource. We derive an analogous form of monogamy inequality, which is based on the partial coherence of the reduced two-qubit and reduced single qubit of the particular class of three-qubit state. Moreover, we provide coherence-based inequality for the classification of GHZ class and W class of three-qubit states. Finally, we provide theoretical discussion for the possible implementation of the scheme in an experiment.},

	title = {The search for a transition: Bayesian models for extrapolation in Hamiltonian parameter spaces},
	abstract = {Despite notable progress in numerical approaches to study strongly correlated electron systems, limitations such as exponential scaling in system size and challenges in the identification of emerging phases still present themselves as major bottlenecks. In this paper, we use data-driven Machine Learning(ML) models to address the outlined drawbacks of numerical methods. Previously, we demonstrated how to extrapolate quantum observables across a phase transition. Here, we extend our work to tackle a higher dimensional problem of extrapolating the physics of polarons under generalized couplings in phonon frequency space using ML. We obtain the data in the adiabatic regime using Green's function cluster expansion(GGCE). We investigate the interplay between prediction accuracies and training regimes and showcase the effectiveness of our approach by accurately predicting sharp transitions at lower phonon frequencies. Furthermore, we make statements about the existence of sharp transition in the extreme adiabatic regime for the Peierls polaron, where variational quantum monte carlo methods fail to converge. These ML-based predictions can guide our understanding of the polaron physics in extreme adiabatic regime which plays a crucial role in the study of high-temperature superconductivity.},

	abstract = {Machine learning algorithms based on parameterized quantum circuit are known to suffer from
				optimization problems such as Barren Plateaus where gradient of cost function vanishes, our goal
				is to optimize variational parameters of a quantum circuit which encodes our input data W (x, θ).
				We establish a compelling connection between the problem of Exponential Concentration(EC) in
				quantum kernels and Barren Plateaus (BP) in variational quantum algorithms. By leveraging
				analytical tools developed for BPs, we derive upper and lower bounds on the concentration of
				quantum resources in EC, identifying conditions under which EC occurs and providing methods to
				mitigate its impact on quantum kernel computations. Additionally, we investigate invariant kernels
				and demonstrate that they can be used to mitigate EC for quantum kernel-based algorithms.},
