  abstract    = {Artificial intelligence has become an important tool in fight against COVID-19. Machine learning models for COVID-19 global pandemic predictions have shown a higher accuracy than the previously used statistical models used by epidemiologists. With the advent of quantum machine learning, we present a comparative analysis of continuous variable quantum neural networks (variational circuits) and quantum backpropagation multilayer perceptron (QBMLP). We analyze the convoluted and sporadic data of two affected countries, and hope that our study will help in effective modeling of outbreak while throwing a light on bright future of quantum machine learning.},

  abstract    = {Games involving quantum strategies often yield higher payoff. Here, we study a practical realization of the three-player dilemma game using the superconductivity-based quantum processors provided by IBM Q Experience. We analyze the persistence of the quantum advantage under corruption of the input states and how this depends on parameters of the payoff table. Specifically, experimental fidelity and error are observed not to be properly anti-correlated; i.e., there are instances where a class of experiments with higher fidelity yields a greater error in the payoff. Further, we find that the classical strategy will always outperform the quantum strategy if corruption is higher than 50\%.},

  abstract    = {Quantum coherence and entanglement originate from the superposition principle. We derive a rigorous relation between the \$\$\{l\_1\}\$\$-norm of coherence and concurrence, in that we show that the former is always greater than the latter. This result highlights the hierarchical relationship between coherence and concurrence, and proves coherence to be a fundamental and ubiquitous resource. We derive an analogous form of monogamy inequality, which is based on the partial coherence of the reduced two-qubit and reduced single qubit of the particular class of three-qubit state. Moreover, we provide coherence-based inequality for the classification of GHZ class and W class of three-qubit states. Finally, we provide theoretical discussion for the possible implementation of the scheme in an experiment.},

  abstract    = {Feasibility of accurate quantum calculations is often restricted by the dimensionality of the truncated Hilbert space required for the numerical computations. The present work demonstrates Bayesian machine learning (ML) models that use quantum properties in an effectively lower-dimensional Hilbert space to make predictions for the Hamiltonian parameters that require a larger basis set as applied to a classical problem in quantum statistical mechanics, the polaron problem. We consider two polaron models: the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model and the mixed SSH-Holstein model. We demonstrate ML models that can extrapolate polaron properties in the phonon frequency. We consider the sharp transition in the ground-state momentum of the SSH polaron and examine the evolution of this transition from the anti-adiabatic regime to the adiabatic regime. We also demonstrate Bayesian models that use the posterior distributions of highly approximate quantum calculations as the prior distribution for models of more accurate quantum results. This drastically reduces the number of fully converged quantum calculations required to map out the polaron dispersion relations for the full range of Hamiltonian parameters of interest.}

  title       = {Equivalence between exponential concentration in quantum kernels and Barren Plateaus in Variational Quantum Algorithms},
  abstract    = {Machine learning algorithms based on parameterized quantum circuit are known to suffer from
                 optimization problems such as Barren Plateaus where gradient of cost function vanishes, our goal
                 is to optimize variational parameters of a quantum circuit which encodes our input data W (x, θ).
                 We establish a compelling connection between the problem of Exponential Concentration(EC) in
                 quantum kernels and Barren Plateaus (BP) in variational quantum algorithms. By leveraging
                 analytical tools developed for BPs, we derive upper and lower bounds on the concentration of
                 quantum resources in EC, identifying conditions under which EC occurs and providing methods to
                 mitigate its impact on quantum kernel computations. Additionally, we investigate invariant kernels
                 and demonstrate that they can be used to mitigate EC for quantum kernel-based algorithms.},
