  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence has become an important tool in fight against COVID-19. Machine learning models for COVID-19 global pandemic predictions have shown a higher accuracy than the previously used statistical models used by epidemiologists. With the advent of quantum machine learning, we present a comparative analysis of continuous variable quantum neural networks (variational circuits) and quantum backpropagation multilayer perceptron (QBMLP). We analyze the convoluted and sporadic data of two affected countries, and hope that our study will help in effective modeling of outbreak while throwing a light on bright future of quantum machine learning.},

	abstract = {Games involving quantum strategies often yield higher payoff. Here, we study a practical realization of the three-player dilemma game using the superconductivity-based quantum processors provided by IBM Q Experience. We analyze the persistence of the quantum advantage under corruption of the input states and how this depends on parameters of the payoff table. Specifically, experimental fidelity and error are observed not to be properly anti-correlated; i.e., there are instances where a class of experiments with higher fidelity yields a greater error in the payoff. Further, we find that the classical strategy will always outperform the quantum strategy if corruption is higher than 50\%.},

	abstract = {Quantum coherence and entanglement originate from the superposition principle. We derive a rigorous relation between the \$\$\{l\_1\}\$\$-norm of coherence and concurrence, in that we show that the former is always greater than the latter. This result highlights the hierarchical relationship between coherence and concurrence, and proves coherence to be a fundamental and ubiquitous resource. We derive an analogous form of monogamy inequality, which is based on the partial coherence of the reduced two-qubit and reduced single qubit of the particular class of three-qubit state. Moreover, we provide coherence-based inequality for the classification of GHZ class and W class of three-qubit states. Finally, we provide theoretical discussion for the possible implementation of the scheme in an experiment.},
