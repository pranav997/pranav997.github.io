        - title: <b> Bayesian extrapolation of observables in Hamiltonian parameter spaces <b>
          contents:
            - I used Gaussian process regression with kernel selection algorithm to extrapolate polaron dispersion relations in hamiltonian parameter space
              such as phonon frequency, momentum, and coupling. Using Green's function cluster expansion for data acquisition in the adiabatic regime,
              the model accurately predicted phase transitions at lower phonon frequencies and explored the extreme adiabatic regime of Peierls polaron
              physics, addressing challenges in High Temperature superconductivity research.
        - title: <b> Equivalence between Barren Plateaus and exponential concentration <b>
          contents:
            - In this project, I derive conditional relations between Barren plateaus in quantum neural and exponential concentration in the quantum kernel, 
              such that one can transfer the training bounds from former to latter. Moreover, I show how equivariant kernels tend to avoid exponential 
              concentrations.
