        - title: Bayesian extrapolation of observables in Hamiltonian parameter spaces
          contents:
            - I used Gaussian process regression to extrapolate polaron dispersion in different regimes and predict phase transition and extreme adiabatic regime polaron behavior.

          contents:
            - *bold Equivalence between Barren Plateaus and exponential concentration* In this project, I derive conditional relations between Barren plateaus in quantum neural and exponential concentration in the quantum kernel, such that one can transfer the training bounds from former to latter. Moreover, I show how equivariant kernels tend to avoid exponential concentrations.
