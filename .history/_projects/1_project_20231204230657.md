Attosecond physics, a field now thrust into the spotlight by Nobel laureates, promises to unveil the intricate electron dynamics within matter using ultrashort lasers. Let's journey back to Fall 2021, when I, a wide-eyed graduate student, had just embarked on my academic path, moved continents, and was about to confront the unexpected challenges and marvels that awaited me. By the way, the thumbnail for this post was generated by AI, so I guess our
jobs are safe for now.

The strong field laser is given by the following expression: $$E_{z}(t) = E_0 \sin(\omega t) \sin^2(\frac{\omega t}{2N_c})$$ where $$E_0$$ is the peak field strength, $$\omega=2\pi/T$$ is the laser frequency, and $$\tau$$ is the pulse duration. The laser is turned on for $$0 < t < N_{c}\cdotT$$. We will consider linearly polarized light, so the electric field is in the $$z$$ direction. $$N_c$$ is the number of cycles in the pulse. The weak field laser is given by $$E_{z}(t) = E_0 \sin(\omega t)$$.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %} -->
