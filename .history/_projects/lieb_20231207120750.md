I had known about Lieb Robinson bounds previously because of the HHKL algorithm <d-cite key="haah2021quantum"></d-cite>. But I never thought of going into
depth, until I attended a talk by Prof. Mari Carmen Ba√±uls, where she talked about one of her papers titled "Light cone tensor network and time evolution" <d-cite key="mari_light"></d-cite> . This sort of reintroduced me to the idea, of how there are bounds on the speed with which information spreads in a quantum system. There are great reviews/notes available for a graduate level introduction to this topic <d-cite key="chen2023speed,hastings2010locality"></d-cite>. Andy Lucas does
a nice job of summarizing it in this Boulder summer school [lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gktIZpPhSM). I have prepared some handwritten notes for the lecture
in case people find them helpful [PDF](/assets/pdf/LB_Bounds.pdf).However, in this post I will talk about what I understand/find interesting about LB bound.

So we consider a local Hamiltonian of the form $$\mathcal{H}=\sum h_x$$ defined on $$n$$ qubits. We have a Hilbert space with $$2^n$$ dimensions such that time evolution of an
initial state $$|\psi(0)\rangle$$ is given by $$|\psi(t)\rangle=e^{-i\mathcal{H}t}|\psi(0)\rangle$$. We are interested in the spread of information in the system. The implementation of such unitaries on a quantum computer is considered efficient if, Unitary $$U$$ can be implemented in time $$t$$ with a number of gates $$g$$ such that $$g\leq poly(n)$$ and $$t\leq poly(n)$$. The trick is to decompose continuos time evolutions into discrete steps such that discrete steps commute, this is known as Trotterization.

{% details Trotterization example %}
Let's say we want to evolve a Hamiltonian given by $$\mathcal{H}=\sum_{i} J(X_{i}X_{i+1} + Y_{i}Y_{i+1}+ Z_{i}Z_{i+1})$$ for time $$t$$. We can decompose the time evolution into $$N$$ steps of size $$\delta t=t/N$$ where $$N$$ is the number of steps. We can write $$U=e^{-i\mathcal{H}t}$$ as $$U=[e^{-i\sum_{i}J\delta t(X_{i}X_{i+1})}e^{-i\sum_{i}J\delta t(Y_{i}Y_{i+1})}e^{-i\sum_{i}J\delta t(Z_{i}Z_{i+1})}]^N$$

## Simple example of a Lieb Robinson bound

Consider a simpler example of a electron hopping on a tight binding lattice with
 nearest neighbour interactions, $$ \mathcal{H}=\sum_{n} J(|n\rangle \langle
 n+1|+|n+1\rangle \langle n|)$$. The dispersion relation is given by
 $$\epsilon_k=-2t\cos{ka} $$ where $$k$$ is the electron momentum. Hence, the
 maxmimum group velocity can be derived as $$v_g= \frac{dw}{dk} \leq 2ta $$. If
 we have a 1D lattice, then the maximum speed with which information can spread
 is $$2ta$$. An interesting question to ask is how does a perturbation at one
 site spread through the lattice. This can be measured by observing the difference between
 the unperturbed time evolved state $$|\psi(t)\rangle=e^{-i\mathcal{H}t}|\psi(0)\rangle $$ with the perturbed state
 $$|\psi(t)\rangle=e^{-i\mathcal{H}t}e^{-iX_0}|\psi(0)\rangle $$.

### Many-Body Scars

Before we dive into many-body scar states, it's essential to understand the broader context of thermalization in quantum systems.

#### Thermalization in Quantum Systems

In quantum mechanics, thermalization refers to the process where a closed quantum system evolves towards thermal equilibrium. This is typically observed in systems with many degrees of freedom. The Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) suggests that individual eigenstates of a quantum system at high energy densities are thermal.

**Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH):**
$$
\langle \psi | \hat{O} | \psi \rangle \approx \text{Tr}(\rho_{\text{thermal}} \hat{O}),
$$
where $$\hat{O}$$ is an observable, $$\psi$$ is an eigenstate, and $$\rho_{\text{thermal}}$$ is the thermal state.

However, not all systems follow the ETH. Two significant exceptions are:

1. **Many-Body Localization (MBL):** In systems with sufficient disorder, local conserved quantities prevent the system from thermalizing. In MBL systems, eigenstates are non-ergodic.

2. **Integrable Systems:** These systems have extensively many conserved quantities that prevent them from reaching thermal equilibrium.

#### Many-Body Scar States

Now, let's focus on many-body scar states, a relatively recent discovery that presents an exception to typical thermalization behavior.

**Definition:**
Many-body scar states are special eigenstates in a non-integrable quantum system that do not thermalize, despite the absence of apparent conserved quantities. These states lead to weak ergodicity breaking.

**Characteristics:**

1. **Prethermalization:** The system initially shows signs of thermalization but eventually deviates from it due to the presence of scar states. It is a phase between thermalization and non-thermalization

2. **Quantum Recurrences:** The system periodically returns to a state close to its initial state.

3. **Entanglement Entropy:** Scar states exhibit sub-volume law entanglement, unlike typical thermal states that follow a volume law.

**Hamiltonian Representation:**

Consider a local Hamiltonian $$ H $$ of a many-body system:
$$
H \sim c^L \quad \text{(exponentially many thermal eigenstates)},
$$
where $$ L $$ is the system size, and $$ c $$ is a constant. For scar states, the Hamiltonian can be represented as:
$$
H_{\text{scar}} \sim L^n \quad \text{(polynomially many thermal scar eigenstates)},
$$
indicating a polynomial number of these special eigenstates.

**Entanglement Entropy Calculation:**

For a system size $$ L $$ and a spin $$ s $$, the Hamiltonian can be represented as:
$$
H \sim (2s + 1)^L.
$$
To compute the half-chain entanglement entropy $$ S $$ for all eigenstates, we use the reduced density matrix (RDM) of a subsystem $$ A $$:
$$
S_A = -\text{Tr}(\rho_A \log \rho_A),
$$
where $$ \rho_A $$ is the RDM of subsystem $$ A $$.

### Conclusion

Many-body scar states represent a fascinating area of study in quantum mechanics and condensed matter physics, challenging our understanding of thermalization and ergodicity in quantum systems. These states could have implications for quantum computing and information preservation in quantum systems.

This brief overview should provide a foundation for a more in-depth exploration of many-body scar states in your studies. The LaTeX code can be seamlessly integrated into a larger document or presentation for academic purposes.
